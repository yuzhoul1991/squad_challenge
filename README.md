# cs224n-win18-squad
Code for the Default Final Project (SQuAD) for [CS224n](http://web.stanford.edu/class/cs224n/), Winter 2018

Note: this code is adapted in part from the [Neural Language Correction](https://github.com/stanfordmlgroup/nlc/) code by the Stanford Machine Learning Group.

In this project, I implemented several recent research papers on the SQuAD challenge including BiDAF, dynamic Co-attention, rnet self matchin attention to study the effectiveness on different attention mechanisms.
The final model achieved a F1 score of 77.6 and a EM score of 68.1 on the test dataset for the SQuAD challenge.
